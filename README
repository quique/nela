This is the nela package.

= About nela =

nela is a software trainer to learn the Braille code, targeted at children
with visual impairment (or completely blind).

It teaches the Braille code slowly and didactically.  Dots, letters, 
syllables, and numbers are introduced in a pedagogically appropriate order.
Any letter the user has difficulty learning, will be presented more often.

Simulating a Perkins machine on the keyboard, its interface intends to be 
accesible, simple, and easy to use.

It's being developed using the Qt libraries, and tested on GNU/Linux and
Microsoft Windows (it would probably also run on Mac OS X with little or
no modification).

Please contribute in any way you can.


= FileSystem Hierarchy =

/trunk    - Main development area. This is where the next major release of
            the code lives, and generally has all the newest features.
/branches - A branch is a copy of code derived from a certain point in the
            trunk.
            It can be used for applying major changes to the code while
            preserving the integrity of the code in the trunk.  If the 
            major changes work according to plan, they are usually merged 
            back into the trunk.
            Creating a branch every time a major version is released allows
            to do bug fixes and make a new release without having to
            release the newest -possibly unfinished or untested- features.
/tags     - A tag is a point-in-time copy of the code as it was at that 
            state.  Useful to signal a major release of the software, or 
            the most stable point of the software before major revisions
            on the trunk were applied.

/trunk/src              - Source code of the program.
/trunk/src/icons        - Icons used for the program.
/trunk/src/levels       - Levels for different languages.
/trunk/src/man          - Manual pages for Unix-like operating systems.
/trunk/src/sounds       - Sounds used in the application, for feedback or 
                          giving instructions.
/trunk/src/tables       - Character -> Braille code tables for languages.
/trunk/src/translations - Translations to different languages.
