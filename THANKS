nela THANKS file

nela was originally written by Enrique Matías Sánchez.  It would
not be what it is today without the invaluable help of these people,
who have reported problems, suggested improvements, or submitted
actual code.  Please help us keep this list complete and free from
errors.  Also see the AUTHORS file for the list of people with
contributions significant enough to warrant copyright assignment.
